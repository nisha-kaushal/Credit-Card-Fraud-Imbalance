# Detecting Credit Card Fraud with Imbalanced Data: Oversampling vs. Undersampling

### Goal: 
Credit card fraud detection using labeled data is one of the main basic projects used while learning about data science, machine learning, and binary classifiers. In this notebook, I am less focused on building simple classification models to detect fraud, and instead, I am curious to test the difference between oversampling and undersampling techniques and their outcomes when applied to highly-imbalanced data, like the dataset used here. Utilizing the Imbalanced-Learn library, my goal is to find which of the two sampling techniques is more useful in highly imbalanced data, and how each affects the accuracy.
### Data Source: 
The data can be found on Kaggle, here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud <br>
